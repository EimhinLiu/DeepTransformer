# DeepTransformer
Code and data from the "DeepTransformer: Node Classification Research of a Deep Graph Network on an Osteoporosis Graph based on GraphTransformer" paper.

MolecularDockingExperienceï¼šIt is the data and results used for molecular docking by the SailVina software, which is available at https://github.com/beikwx/SailVina/.

data:It contains the compound data and target data needed to build the graph data.

.py:First run the preprocessing.py file, then run the build_graph.py file, and finally use deep_gnn.py to train and predict.
